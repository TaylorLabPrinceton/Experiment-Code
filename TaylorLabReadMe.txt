Read me file for Taylor Lab git depository

* A file called ".gitignore" has been created. Any file names or directories(followed by a /) that are listed in this file will be ignored for the git repository. This can be useful in not filling up the depository with extraneous things (ie data from testing)

* All folders called "Data" will be ignored. This is because an entry exists in .gitignore for it, and otherwise the depository would fill.
